<p>This extension allows Burp to view and modify binary SOAP objects.</p>

<p>In general, the extension will deserialize messages, allow the user to view 
and modify them, and then reserialize them before sending on. In the case of the 
Scanner, the extension will leave messages deserialized, to enable Burp to 
access the contents of deserialized objects (to identify error messages, etc.).</p>

<p>This extension requires a Microsoft Windows environment.</p>
